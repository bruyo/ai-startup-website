# Hands-On Git Project: Collaborative Website Development with Git and GitHub

In this mini-project, we'll create a step-by-step project to stimulate the workflow of Tom and Jerry using Git and GitHub. This hands-on project will include 
installation of Git, setting up a GitHub repository, cloning the repository, creating branches, making changes, and merging those changes back into the main branch.


## Part 1: Setup and Initial Configuration
